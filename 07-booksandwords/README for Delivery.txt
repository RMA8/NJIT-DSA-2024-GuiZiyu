1. hash funtion: key % length of the array
2. Insert the key as an array, use loop to get the top 100.
3. To avoid overflow, I partiton, discart one part and then quiksort, then the overflow disappears and the programme can pass the test.
4. I think my time complexity is good. I use Hoare partiton and change something. Time complexity: O(n logn).
5. Understand the "BadBookimplemetation" and then programming myself is difficult. The count is also difficult.
6. I really understand the time complexity of the code.
